Welcome to the year 30**10**. It was my first day as Intergalactic Space Sheriff, so I decided to patrol planet **ASUS**. I jumped into my space **rocket**, turned on the antigravity **table**, and traveled at **large** speed toward the planet. When I stepped onto the **small** surface, I came face-to-face with an alien. He was the size of a(n) **chair** and looked like a giant lump of **biscuits**. “**stupid**,” I said to him, the galactic word for “hello.” But the alien didn’t respond. Instead he pulled out his laser **flower**, **ran** my vehicle, then tried to **smack** me. Quickly I activated my defense **phone**. The laser beam **stole** off it and hit the alien on the **face**. “**WTS**!” yelled the alien as he turned into a big puddle of **worm**. Exhausted, I teleported back to the space station near **Earth**. This job is going to be tougher than I thought.
